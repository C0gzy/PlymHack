
QUESTION:


Rolan is a carpenter aboard a long-voyage ship.

To prepare the ship’s deck for the journey ahead, Rolan needs to build wooden tables for the crew. Crafting a single wooden table requires 'C' pieces of wood, which are obtained from the ship’s stored timber.

Rolan has a tool pouch with limited space that can hold both wood and completed tables. The pouch has 'N' slots. Each slot can contain either:

one completed wooden table, or

a pile of wood containing at most 'P' pieces.

At the beginning, Rolan has 'W' pieces of wood, which she may distribute arbitrarily among the 'N' slots.

To craft a wooden table, Rolan removes 'C' pieces of wood from any combination of slots. If a pile of wood becomes empty, its slot becomes free. If there is no free slot available, crafting immediately stops. Otherwise, the newly crafted table is placed into a free slot.

Rolan continues crafting tables as long as possible.




Input Format

A single line containing four integers
C, N, P, and W.

Output Format

Output a single integer — the number of wooden tables that Rolan can craft.

Constraints

1≤𝐶,𝑁,𝑃,𝑊≤10^15

W≤N×P
